# Transcribly
The best solution for transcribing virtual meetings

Transcribly is an advanced platform that provides impeccable transcription services for virtual meetings, delivering unparalleled accuracy and user-friendly design. 

It serves as an accessible solution, mitigating the obstacles faced by individuals with hearing loss by providing comprehensive support and empowering their active engagement in various contexts.

Initially, we decided to intergate Microsoft Azureâ€™s live-captioning service and create a website that allows users to transcribe meetings. However due to the time frame and the complexity of Azure, we decided to focus mainly on the front end.

We started off by checking out other softwares in the market that strive to tackle accessibility issues.
Next we tackled issues that users commonly face with such softwares, such as information overload and transcribing delay
We then proceeded to design our website, first from paper wireframes and then to a prototype on figma that allowed us to visualize the UI/UX.

Once we were done with the coding, we created a github repo to push our code, then used netlify DNS and a goDaddy domain to deploy our demo website onto the web. it can be viewed at transcribly.co
